Lecture Contents
================

This is our first lecture, in which we will have a look at the organization of the course and start off with the basic ingredients of **Geometrical Optics**.
While during Experimental Physics 2, you did already address electrical oscillators and the wave equation, we would like to start with Geometrical Optics here, as this is the simples form of describing light propagation and it turns out to be a limit of electromagnetic optics. Many of the phenomena in optics can already be sufficiently understood in this limit.
