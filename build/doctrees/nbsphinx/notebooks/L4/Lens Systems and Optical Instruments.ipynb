They are combined at distances, which are either larger or smaller than the sum of their focal distances.

    "Following this equation the inverse of the total focal length of the combined lenses is just the sum of its inverse focal distances minus a term, which depends on the distance of the two lenses. If this distance is small as compared to the focal length, i.e. the lenses are close to each other, the total inverse focal is just given by the first two terms. The inverse focal distances characterize the refractive power of a lens. The larger the invserse value, the smaller is the focal distance. This refractive power is commonly measured in the unit **diopter**. One diopter corresponds to **1 dpt=1 $m^{-1}$**."

    "For more than two lenses, there is a versatile framework called **Matrix Optics**, which treats each optical element as a 2x2 matrix. This becomes possible as we derived earlier equations which were linear in $y$ and $\\theta$. A whole system of different lenses, plates and other optical elements can thus be treated as a matrix multiplication, which is quite useful. "
