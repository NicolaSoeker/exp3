    "The vectorial nature of electric and magnetic fields are the new property that we inserted into our description of wave propagation. Elecric and magnetic fields, while propagating along a certain direction, have a specific direction in the lab frame, which can change over time in specific ways. This stationary state of the direcion of the elecric field vector is termed **polarization**. You may also use teh magnetic field to define polarization, by commonly this is done using the electric field direction."

    "The polarization of light is important for many applications including for example 3D cinema or TV. The polarization state is commonly changed when light interacts with matter, therefore polarization is also a very important tool to characterize materials. For example, the technique of **ellipsometry** is studying the polarization state of light reflected from a material therby gaining important information about the electronic properties of the material. This is an important tool on solid-state physics. The polarization of light is also important for interence as two wave of orthogonal directions of the elecric field cannot interference (please check this idea yourself). It can be also used to encode information for quantum cryptography. \n",
